# Lone Dynamics Toolchain Snapshots

This is a collection of snapshots of open-source tools that can used to build gateware for Lone Dynamics FPGA computers. You're probably better off using the latest versions of these tools, but this repo will provide known-working snapshots because these tools are critical for the future usefulness of the FPGA computers and the latest versions of the tools occasionally introduce bugs and incompatibilities.
